    "# Olive API for Python Tutorial \n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial explains how to use the Olive API for Python to access the Olive server.  This is a new feature in Olive 5.0 and can be used to write your own Python scripts.\n",
    "\n",
    "This interface is client-server oriented.  You are writing a client, which will send requests to the server.  The basic flow is to:\n",
    "1. Create a client object.\n",
    "2. Connect to the server.\n",
    "3. Send one or more requests the server.\n",
    "4. Disconnect from the server.\n",
    "\n",
    "Important notes about this library:\n",
    "* Olive 5.0 uses Python 3.  The interface is tested with Python 3.8.1 on Windows and 3.6.7 on Linux, but should work with all 3.x versions on all platforms.\n",
    "* The python directory where this source code is located must be in your PYTHONHOME environment variable.\n",
    "* The Olive runtime must also be in your PYTHONHOME.\n",
    "* There are no timeouts, so if your request \"hangs\" forever, that usually means that the server is not running or is not running on the machine or port you have connected to.\n",
    "* Most examples do not handle server side exceptions. See the Error Handling example for one that does.\n",
